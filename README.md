# Binary-Search-Tree

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Binary Search Tree using templates. 
A Binary Search Tree is a type of binary tree where, for each node, all the values in the left subtree are less than the value of the node,
and all the values in the right subtree are greater than the value of the node.

## Usage

To use the Binary Search Tree class, you must include the BinarySearchTree.h header file in your program. 
Then, you can create a new instance of the class, specifying the type of the data that will be stored in the tree.

## Functionality

The Binary Search Tree class has several methods available for inserting new elements, searching for elements, 
traversing the tree in different ways, and getting the height of the tree. There are also methods to return the maximum and minimum elements in the tree.
## Implementation

The BinarySearchTree class is defined in the BinarySearchTree.h header file and consists of two other classes: TreeNode and BinarySearchTree. 
The TreeNode class represents a single node in the tree, and the BinarySearchTree class represents the binary search tree. 
The repository also includes several optional helper methods that you can use to implement additional functionality. <br>
Note: The BST implemented here is the AVL BST.
